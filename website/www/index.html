    <h2>What is Hegemonie?</h2>
    <time datetime="2020-12-30">Edited at December the 30th, 2020.</time>
    <p>
      Hegemonie is a game engine that allows users to control cities on region maps.
      Each region instance is animated by a game master in charge of the narrative frame of the campaign.
      The goal of a user is to increase his/her influence on each region.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game engine ships with default content that provide a medieval fantastic environment.
      However, the game engine itself isn't typed for med-fan only.
    </p>

    <h2>The Technical Stack</h2>
    <time datetime="2020-12-30">Edited at December the 30th, 2020.</time>

    <h3>Micro-services architecture</h3>
    <p>
    All the backend code is written in <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://golang.org">Golang</a>.
    <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a> is the middleware shared by all our microservices.
    <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> is also used in the AAA-related services.
    </p>
    <p>
    The persistence of the data for each service currently depend on the type of service:<ul>
      <li>
        maps: the local filesystem is currently used, with one file per map.
        There are plans to locate the maps on an Object Storage platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        events: a local <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://github.org/jfsmig/rocksdb">RocksDB</a> database is currently used.
        There are plans for a <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://tikv.org/">TiKV</a> storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        region: a local file system is currently used.
        There are plans for a <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://tikv.org/">TiKV</a> storage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Technical enablers</h3>
    <p>
    The <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.ory.sh">ORY</a> suite is used at the gate.
    OpenIO Connect is used for the Authentication via <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.ory.sh/hydra/">ORY Hydra</a>.
    The authorization of the users on their cities is achieved with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.ory.sh/keto/">ORY Keto</a>.
    A local user registry is available thanks to <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.ory.sh/kratos/">ORY Kratos</a>, as a source for ORY Hydra.
    The security is enforced at the gate, in the API micro-service that requires valid <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://jwt.io">JSON Web Tokens</a> for each RPC.
    </p>
    <p>
    The monitoring of the timeseries of the platform is achieved with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a>.
    A set of exporters is in place for the gRPC services.
    </p>
    <p>
    The monitoring of the hosts is achieved via <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.netdata.cloud">NetData</a>.
    No data from Netdata is centralized in Prometheus.
    </p>
    <p>
    The fine-grained observability of the execution of the RPC calls is allowed by <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</a>.
    Traces are generated in a side-car agent.
    By default, the sandbox installation proposes an all-in-one installation with its own Prometheus storage and a dashboard.

    <h2>Hegemonie is back!</h2>
    <time datetime="2020-12-30">Edited at December the 30th, 2020.</time>
    <p>
      I am proud to announce that your favorite RPG between 1999 and 2003 will be back soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of Hegemonie didn't vanish. As a new year's resolution for 2020, I decided
      to reboot the game engine. I admit... it happened in a moment of nostalgia.
      While reconnecting with old players, I noticed that nobody forgot the experience.
      I was aware that a few of them continued the effort during one or two years after
      the official game ended.
      But I discovered that even 10 years after, some aficionados had rewritten an entire
      world. And you know what? They lack the skills to write a game engine.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Masters made Hegemonie so special</h3>
    <p>
      Hegemonie had <em>Game Masters</em>. Each GM was in charge of a game instance and
      its few non-player characters. He/She ensured a coarse narrative frame and stimulated
      the instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its history, Hegemonie had 3 kinds of instances. The first was populated with
      players actually knowing each others in the real life. This was probably the most
      active but also the easiest to control. The second kind of population was 40%
      inactive, and the 60% remaining moving at a slow pace. The third instance was mostly
      active, 100% remote and prone to declare the war against the all local NPC.
      And the magic happened on all of those instances, sometimes with deviant behaviors,
      sometimes with more or less success. Many lessons have been learned, many feedback
      have been gathered.
    </p>

    <h3>A new game engine</h3>
    <p>
      The current effort focuses the game engine. It of the world and its internal logic.
      It includes representing cities, learning science, raising troops, assaulting
      or defending, trading resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous version of Hegemonie had major lacks that prohibited it to scale.

      A general lack of tests that caused the highly flawed code to ship in production.
      Many players silentely benefitted some bugs, others suffered.

      A complete absence of reporting on the activity on a game instance made that it
      was not possible to spot inactive zones or fake accounts. Hegemonie provided
      no tool to the animators to trigger technical actions, spread rumors. The only
      lever was text-based Role-Play. It was just a nice game for communities of max
      40 players meeting in the real life. And worst of all, it was full-time job to
      animate such a community. This is a sign: it is not sustainable and it could not
      last long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new game engine will address these limitations. I plan to provide the meaningful
      reporting to make unbalanced situations obvious. Representing the relationships
      between the characters is a must-have. The stimulation of the game requires to check
      the RP is respected. I must have only one goal in mind: make the animation becomes
      fun and hassle-free.
    </p>

    <h3>Up to the standards of the State of the Art</h3>
    <p>
      The original game was all made of PHP logic entangled with HTML generation, plus
      a burden of stored procedures in a PostreSQL database, old-style authentication
      based on session tokens, etc etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      20 years later we learned the benefit of well documennted API, the benefits of
      test-driven development and CI/CD, micro-services architectures, the needs for
      standard middlewares like gRPC, OpenAPI, OpenTelemetry and OpenID Connect, techniques
      like JWT for authentication and authorization purposes, etc.
      We also have tools like Consul, Docker and Kubernetes, as well as languages like Go
      giving much higher expectations and shipping with a rich ecosystem, etc etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      No need to say that the new game engine should encompass all this.
    </p>

    <h3>What's next?</h3>
    <p>
      What will happen after the development phase? Many things because there are many
      challenges. As an example there is a high risk that the system will adopt a new
      name because of trademark constraints. Only few items are on the roadmap. Only
      those who are certain yet.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 0: Content Creation</h4>
    <p>
      A game engine is cool but when it pushes a valuable content, it is much better!
      Then we will focus on creating a content like in the old days of Hegemonie.
      It won't be possible to recreate it as is because everything has been lost.
      Instead, we'll target the core configuration of the world and a scenario frame
      for a few empires that could be a sequel for Hegemonie VII.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 1: Friendly user test (Alpha Test)</h4>
    <p>
      The first step will start with players already aware of Hegemonie, i.e. the old
      players or their friends. Why? Because I am one of them, because I also do reboot
      the game for myself. All of us were college students with plenty of idle time.
      20 years later we turned into a workers and family guys &amp; gals. So I have to
      check how the system must evolve to fit our current rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few assumptions need a validation. I have in mind the partition of the users
      into autonomous regions. I also think to the exchanges between compatible
      regions, etc. And the list is not exhaustive. This is the goal of this Alpha test:
      a technical validation of the design. The KPI is simple: do the players enjoy the
      experience?
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2: (Beta Test)</h4>
    <p>
      It is time to test the game on a pseudo-random population of players. They should
      be unaware of Hegemonie but simple RPG players and masters. My expectation is that
      the population will contain inactive citizens, fake accounts, remote players,
      etc etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefit I expected from the Beta is a measurement of the time spent in game
      mastery. During the Beta we should be aware of lacks on the admin side. We should
      know more about the expected skill of the game masters. I expect a set of guidelines
      about how to populate game instances to ensure a constant activity. In term of number
      of players, of variety of characters.
    </p>

    <h3>Sustainability as a long term goal</h3>
    <p>
      All the burden described here-above has a cost. I am happy to pay it with my idle
      time for the initial development phase. But as soon as it is testable (a MVP),
      Hegemonie will require resources I do not have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creative talent is my major lack. I cannot manage content creation. Here will
      I need the help of the community. Many ways are possible. It may take the form
      of crowd funding for well-bounded projects. It can also be a direct participation,
      artwork produced by the community itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there is moment when financial resources will also be required for the hosting
      itself. Here do I imagine two options. Either a yearly fundraiser or a minimal
      subscription. But ... honestly, I don't know. This is way too early.
