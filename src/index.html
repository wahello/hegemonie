  <h2>What is Hegemonie?</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-12-30">Edited at December the 30th, 2020.</time>

  <p>
    Hegemonie is a game engine building civ-like online game instances.
    Users manage in-game characters, each character controls City-States
    on region maps. Each region instance is animated by a game master
    in charge of the narrative frame of the campaign.
  </p>

  <h2>A Game Engine</h2>
  <p>
    The Hegemonie initiative focuses on building tools to easy and reliabily
    host online roleplay games. The target of the engine is to become an
    empty shell that allows a simple and pluggable configuration.
    For testability purposes, the game engine ships with default content that
    provide a medieval-fantastic environment. I admit it, I plan to eventually
    recreate a world that is close from the origial Hegemonie IV.

  <h2>Running Civ-Like Games</h2>
  <p>
    In a game instance managed by Hegemonie, a logged user manages his/her
    in-game characters. One charcater is owner of the City-State, and an optional
    second character may be designed as an administrator. Both are in charge
    of the development of the City-State and its relationships with the rest
    of the instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each city-state is characterized by stockpiles of raw resources, a knowledge
    tree, a set of buildings and a pool of units. The progression in the knowledge
    tree is driven by allow/forbid contraintes among the skills. An owned 
    skill may open the door to buildings, and each building may open to the
    recritment of a new kind of Unit. Both skills and buildings have an effect on
    the City-State. 
    Several key factor also have a latent but permanent impact of the development
    of a City-state. They describe the alignment, the neutrality, a pantheon and
    a faction.
  </p>
  <p>
    A game instance, in an Hegemonie system, is called a Region. It has a map
    that is well known and chosen at the instanciation of the region.
    That's why Hegemonie's instance may not be called "4X", because there is no
    "eXploration.
  </p>

  <h2>Libre And Open Source</h2>
  <p>
    We want to avoid any friction in the process of adopting the game engine. Gaming
    is about pleasure and you should feel no annoyance. So the choice of a very
    liberal open source license ${link('https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/','MPLv2')}
    allows you a complete reversibility of your game instance, from a provider to another.
    Also there couldn't be any legal concerns, the game engine is free to use even for
    commercial purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>We Are Open!</h2>
  <p>
    The game engine isn't ready to rock yet. We are a small team, time is a scarce
    resource so the pace of the evolution is slow. Most importantly, we are open to
    external contributions as well as incorporating new members in the team. If you
    feel an interest in our initiative, feel free to ping us!
