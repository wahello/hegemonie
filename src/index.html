  <h2>What is Hegemonie?</h2>

  <p>
    Hegemonie is a game engine building civ-like game instances. Users manage characters,
    the characters control cities on region maps. Each region instance is animated by
    a game master in charge of the narrative frame of the campaign.

  <h2>Hegemonie is a Game Engine</h2>
  <p>
    The game engine ships with default content that provide a medieval fantastic environment.
    However, the game engine itself isn't typed for med-fan only.

  <h2>Civ-Like Games</h2>

  <h2>Hegemonie is Open Source</h2>
  <p>
    We want to avoid any friction in the process of adopting the game engine. Gaming
    is about pleasure and you should feel no annoyance. So the choice of a very
    liberal open source license ${link('','MPLv2')} allows you a complete
    reversibility of your game instance, from a provider to another. Also there
    couldn't be any legal concerns, the game engine is free to use even for
    commercial purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Hegemonie is Under Construction Source</h2>
  <p>
    The game engine isn't ready to rock, yet. We are a small team, time is a scarce
    resource so the pace of the evolution is slow. Most importantly, we are open to
    external contributions as well as incorporating new members in the team. If you
    feel an interest in our initiative, feel free to ping us!
