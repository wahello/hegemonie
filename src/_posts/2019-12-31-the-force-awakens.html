  Maybe is it nostalgia. But I feel something.
  I feel there's an opportunity to take.

  Was it a surge of nostalgia? Probably!
</p>
<p>
  Maybe one month ago, I started thinking actively about a past gaming experience.
  It is now 19 years ago that I started to play to <em>Hegemonie IV</em>. The fourth
  edition, I was granted the <em>Longwalliens</em> fief. At that time, there was just
  one <em>empire</em> (i.e. one map) named <em>Calaquyr</em> and nicknamed
  <em>La Louve</em> (translated to "the wolf").

  First reflex, open ${link("https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/go/", "GoLand")}
  and start writing. Its was just the very early basics of the game-engine logic,
  but it brought enough satisfaction to propel me to the next step.
</p>
<p>
  There is something to come. Soon? I don't think so! I know it takes time, more
  than I have. But it's on its rails.
