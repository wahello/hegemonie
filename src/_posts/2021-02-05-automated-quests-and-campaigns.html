  Game Masters made the game experience so special with Hegemonie.
  It's time to push that one step beyond.

  I'll repeat it forever: the original Hegemonie was awesome thanks to the alchemy
  between its players and its game masters. On one hand, you had high exceptations
  from passionated players. They expected a rich environment, an unpredictable
  story and a taylor-made animation. On the other hand, a small team of game
  masters made their possible to meet these expectation. It was a success but it
  was neither easy nor a sustainable effort.
