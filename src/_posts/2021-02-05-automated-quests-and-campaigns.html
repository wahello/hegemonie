  Game Masters made the game experience so special with Hegemonie.
  It's time to push that one step beyond.

<h2>Hegemonie I to VII was great...</h2>
<p>
  I'll repeat it forever: the original Hegemonie was awesome thanks to the alchemy
  between its players and its game masters. On one hand, you had high expectations
  from passionate players. They expected a rich environment, an unpredictable
  story and a tailor made animation. On the other hand, a small team of game
  masters made their possible to meet these expectations. It was a success.
</p>

<h2>... But it Eventually Failed</h2>
<p>
  It was a success, but it was neither easy nor a sustainable effort. And that's
  the reason of the failure. The whole population started as students with plenty
  of idle time, and they eventually turned into young active workers. The reality
  then exploded: the system wasn't designed to scale. The GM tried to keep the
  bar high, but they *all* burnt out.
</p>
<p>
  Too much attention has to be paid by each GM to its empire. Literally everything
  was done via instant messaging. It has a noble trait because this was pure
  role-play, manipulation and storytelling. Even the action of each GM on his/her
  world was hardly more than just this. The reporting was lacking on the real
  activity of each empire "under the hood". No quest was automated, barely a
  minimalistic yet smart "altar" (i.e. an HTML form) that served all the quests
  and reacted to obscure incantations (i.e. input).
</p>
<p>
  Therew were bugs that have been heavily exploited before anyone noticed,
  suspicions of favoritism of some GM toward a subset of players, technical
  breaches exploited by players to grant amounts of resources.
  Many odd behaviors that could be avoided with some autmation and clear
  reporting.
