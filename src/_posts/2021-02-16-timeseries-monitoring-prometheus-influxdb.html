  Technical tools hardly escape the natural trend toward more entropy.
  Particularly the timeseries databases.

  <em>Disclaimer: This is an opinionated post. More than usually.</em>
  Here do I give you a hint on how to waste precious time while working on
  a side project. Just try to collect non-trivial metrics from core entities
  of your business. Like monitoring the activity of the Cities in an Hegemonie
  instance.
</p>

<h2>Push vs. Pull</h2>
<p>
  There is no big deal here since each method has its advantages. Pull is seen
  simpler to deploy, while Push is seen simpler to scale. "Pull" partisans will
  tell you that you know what you did deploy. So you know what/where to
  monitor, then just configure that in the collector.
</p>
<p>
  Scaling is not an issue for me in the context of Hegemonie. First thing
  first, I would manage that topic when foreseeing a scalability issue.
  Let's buid a MVP first.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, in my case I monitor neither system metrics nor service
  metrics. I typically need to discover the entities, then collect the stats
  from each of them. This is way easy easier to achieve in a <em>PUSH</em>
  model because each services <em>knows</em> the entities it manages. I don't
  need to discover what to pull.
</p>

<h2>Prometheus: Wrong Pattern, Buggy.</h2>
<p>
  Famous and obvious, CNCF managed, Liberal Apache-2.0 License, Pull-oriented.
</p>
<p>
  A bug like ${link('https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3746','#3746')}
  just tells you that 1/ Prometheus just doesn't work for a very simple use
  case and that 2/ it's team listen to no-one in their community.
</p>
<p>
  However, if I consider this as just a bug (because it is) that will be
  eventually fixed. If I give a chance to Prometheus, what should I do to
  cope with its unwanted Pull pattern? I should develop a service discovery
  module to inform Prometheus about the regions, and then develop an exporter
  that would convert region stats into Prometheus compliant stats.
</p>

<h2>InfluxDB v2.0.X: What's wrong with it?!</h2>
<p>
  Famous but less than Prometheus, managed by a company, non-compete
  Licensing model, Push-oriented.
</p>
<p>
  I initially gave a try to InfluxDB in 2015, it was v0.8.x, my use case was
  simple.  I had a wonderful experience with it. Then I gave it another try
  in the context of Hegemonie. We are in 2021, I am picking InfluxDB v2.0.4,
  and the journey didn't end well.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I try the Docker image to integrate it into my Docker-Compose
    configuration. Argl, they use RedHat's Quay.io whose manifest isn't
    known on my Ubuntu distribution. I need to allow that at the system
    level, just for one tool... I'm sorry but no.
  </li>
  <li>I want to rebuild the Docker image using the provided configuration.
    Argl, I need to install yarn and rustup, I already have nodejs, npm,
    rustc and cargo. I understand that the built-in dashboard evolved a bit
    since 2015.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ok, I have the tools installed. I launch the `docker build` command.
    Wow, roughly 3000 nodejs packages are fetched. Argl... <em>Javascript
    Heap, out of memory</em>. 4GB are not enough. I am not alone in that
    case, someone already opened a ticker about that, I drop a comment
    and my workaround.
  </li>
  <li>
    The docker Image is ready, I push it in my own repository on the
    Docker Hub. I integrate a container and spawn it in my docker-compose
    stack. It seems to work... Ah, not really. The UI isn't as expected,
    I just have a black screen, and Firefox's console shows that a
    Web Assembly module (WASM) has an unexpected MIME-Type. Holy Sh*t,
    I am not the first to encounter this, there's also a ticket for that.
  </li>
  <li>
    That's just the UI, maybe does the API endpoint work well. I try the
    influx CLI to list the registered organizations... "Endpoint unexpectedly
    closed the connection". That's maybe my fault, a misconfiguration of
    docker-compose.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  And I had to stop there, I started at 10:30PM, it was then 1:30AM and I was
  tired. I just keep in mind that if it is that complicated out of the box,
  this is a bad sign for the rest of the adventure. Hey InfluxData, it should
  not be that complicated!
</p>

<h2>InfluxDB v.1.8.4: Simple, Straight To The Point</h2>
<p>
  Famous but less than Prometheus, managed by a company, non-compete
  Licensing model, Push-oriented.
</p>
<p>
  I don't know what happened to InfluxData when they designed InfluxDB v2.
  There is a huge gap in the unboxing experience! In 2.0.X *noting* worked,
  in 1.8.X it just worked well. I had the feeling of a mature tool. The docs
  were clear, the tooling just as good as expected. And the magic happened,
  it just worked!
</p>
<p>
  As I said, the poor experience with InfluxDB 2.0.4 cannot be anything else
  than a transitional state. InfluxData promises that using the
  v2 client makes the code interoperable with InfluxDB 1.8.x and 2.0.x.
  It makes me confident in the stability of my choice.
